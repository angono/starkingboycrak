Nice — I created a full static website scaffold for **Starking Boycrak** (4 HTML pages: homepage, shop, songs, services) styled with Tailwind and designed to be elegant, modern, and fully functional **without custom JavaScript**.

You can find the complete code in the canvas document titled **"Starking Boycrak — Website (HTML + Tailwind)"**. It includes:

* `index.html` — Hero, masthead, about, modern gallery, featured projects, social links, footer.
* `shop.html` — Responsive product cards for merch.
* `songs.html` — Track list with `<audio controls>` elements (replace with your hosted files).
* `services.html` — Comprehensive list of services with CTA.
* Clear comments and notes on where to replace images/audio, how to add products, and hosting tips.

Next steps I suggest (pick any, I can do them now if you want):

* Replace the placeholder images/audio with your real assets and I can update the code paths.
* Convert this into a static site generator setup (Hugo / Eleventy) or a simple GitHub Pages deployment guide.
* Add a printable or downloadable press kit page (bio, high-res photos, contact).
* Create responsive image optimization suggestions and accessibility checks.

Tell me which of the above you'd like me to do next, or ask for edits (colors, typography, layout tweaks, or more pages) and I’ll update the canvas.
